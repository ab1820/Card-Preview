## My process

<p>- The process so far....
  I knew I wanted to start this design with Flexbox. Easier said than done for us still learning. 
It only took me a day and a half to look, and look, and look on why my entire container was not centering on the page. 
It turns out you should probably give your container a height first, once you do that, it will center vertically on the page. **Finally!!** 
<br>
I hadn't learned about <code>object-fit</code> just yet, and knew I had to crop the image while keeping the aspect ratio. I started doing some digging and quickly learned the basics of adjusting the image without losing its ratio and I am proud of that! :)</p>

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to apply <code>object-fit</code> to my image, and correctly horizontally and vertically center an object/container using flexbox. 

Learning is a never-ending process, you better enjoy it!


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I will always continue to learn everyday as I go, with whatever project I am working on. 
But first, mobile first! 
- Responsiveness 100%
- CSS Grid
